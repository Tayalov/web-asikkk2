    <p>
      At <strong>MedLine</strong>, we are committed to fighting oncology.  
      Our goal is to study cancer, understand its causes, and develop new ways to diagnose and treat it.  
      We believe that by combining advanced medical research with compassionate care, we can give hope to millions of patients worldwide.  
      MedLine strives to become a place where science and humanity work together to defeat cancer.
    </p>
    <p>
    MedLine was founded in 2025 with the goal of becoming a place where medical 
    knowledge, research, and patient care come together. Although we are a young 
    organization, we are full of energy, determination, and a strong mission to 
    improve people’s lives.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our main focus is on oncology — studying the causes of cancer, finding new 
    diagnostic tools, and working on effective treatments. At the same time, we 
    are committed to raising awareness about prevention, early detection, and 
    supporting patients and their families during difficult times.
  </p>
  <p>
    We believe this is only the beginning. In the coming years, MedLine will 
    continue to grow, expand its services, and contribute to many good causes 
    in healthcare. Together with our partners and community, we aim to build a 
    future where medicine is not only about treatment, but also about hope, 
    compassion, and innovation.
